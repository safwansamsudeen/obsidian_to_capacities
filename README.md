# python-xcall

A Python [x-callback-url](http://x-callback-url.com) client for bi-directional
communication with x-callback-url enabled macOS applications. python-xcall supports callbacks from appplications. It wraps the handy
[xcall](https://github.com/martinfinke/xcall) command line tool.

It is used by:
- [python-ulysses-client](https://github.com/robwalton/ulysses-python-client)

## Software compatability
Requires:
- macOS
- python 2.7
- Uses [xcall](https://github.com/martinfinke/xcall) (included).
- Needs pytest and mock for testing

## Installation
Check it out:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/robwalton/python-xcall.git
Cloning into 'python-xcall'...
```

## Basic use
Call a scheme (ulysses) with an action (get-version):
```python
>>> import xcall
>>> xcall.xcall('ulysses', 'get-version')
{u'apiVersion': u'2', u'buildNumber': u'33542'}
```
An x-success reply will be utf-8 un-encoded, then url unquoted, and then  un-marshaled using json into Python objects and returned.

A dictionary of action parameters can also be provided (each value is utf-8
encoded and then url quoted before sending):
```python
>>> xcall.xcall('ulysses', 'new-sheet', {'text':'My new sheet', 'index':'2'})
```
If the application calls back with an x-error, an `XCallbackError` will be raised:
```python
>>> xcall.xcall('ulysses', 'an-invalid-action')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
...
XCallbackError: x-error callback: '{
  "errorMessage" : "Invalid Action",
  "errorCode" : "100"
}
' (in response to url: 'ulysses://x-callback-url/an-invalid-action')
```

## More control
For more control create an instance of `xcall.XCallClient`, specifying the scheme to use, whether responses should be un-marshaled using json, and an x-error handler. For example:
```python
class UlyssesError(XCallbackError):
    pass

def ulysses_xerror_handler(xerror, requested_url):
    error_message = eval(xerror)['errorMessage']
    error_code = eval(xerror)['errorCode']
    raise UlyssesError(
        ("%(error_message)s. Code=%(error_code)s. "
         "In response to sending the url '%(requested_url)s'") % locals())

ulysses_client = XCallClient(
    'ulysses', on_xerror_handler=ulysses_xerror_handler,  json_decode_success=True)

```
Make calls using:
```python
>>> ulysses_client.xcall('get-version')
```
or just:
```python
>>> ulysses_client('get-version')
```

## Logging
As logger output just goes directly to the terminal, it is disabled by default. To enable more verbose logging use:
```python
>>> import xcall
>>> xcall.enable_verbose_logging()
```

## On thread/process safety
Call to this module are __probably__ not thread/process safe. An attempt is made
to ensure that `xcall` is not already running, but there is 20-30ms window in which
multiple calls to this module will result in multiple xcall processes running
and the chance of replies being mixed up.

## Testing
Running the tests requires the `pytest` and `mock` packages. Some optional integration
tests currently require [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com). Code your 
access-token into the top of `test_calls.py`. Obtain the access token string by removing the @skip
marker from `test_authorise()` in `test_calls.py` and running the tests. 

From the root package folder call:
```bash
MacBook:python-xcall walton$ pytest
...
```

## Todo

- Upload PyPi after working out how distrubute the lib folder containing xcall.app.
- Logs could go somewhere more sensible that stdout.
